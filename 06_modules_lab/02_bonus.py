""" Write a program that reads 2 numbers from sys.argv
and prints their sum.
Bonus: Print error messages for invalid inputs.

To print error messages we'll have to use a concept not yet learned in the
course, and which will only be presented later: Exceptions.
We'll tap into python's error handling and change its default
error message to something more meaningful.
